## For a new job opportunity

# The challenge has been completed!

# Steps by step:
1. Read several times until having a complete understanding of the requirements
2. Configure my development environment and the public repository
3. Create some git branches to follow my plan
4. I have read the legacy code to know how it was working I have to changed the naming of some variables to understand the purpose of everything
5. Code readability was not good enough so I extracted some methods, renamed some variables as well as had created a new Domain layer, it is also useful for unit testing
6. Refactor the code to avoid having nested 'For' loops I use projection to return new objects as a response combined with linq
7. Implement each one of the requirements
8. Implement more test case scenarios
